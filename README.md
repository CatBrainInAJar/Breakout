# Time Details and Changelist
<Add information to this section about the time you've taken for this task along with a professional changelist.

fixed bug took around about 30 minutes of looking but couldn't find more than 1, removed the include causing issues in powerupBase.h
added a life buff to the game, took a lot longer then initialy thought as I encountered some problems - including updating the ui when life was given causing the game to crash, sadly couldn't fix it. this took 1 hr and 30 minutes on and off

added a ball enlarge and a small ball "power-up" (these are 2 separate classes), this took 40 minutes

attempted multi-ball power-up, this took 30 minutes
